<h4>Hello everyone!</h4>
I'm [[About\|Vinayak]].
I am a student, currently pursuing my <font color="#76923c">Bachelors</font> at <a href = "https://nitdgp.ac.in/"> National Institute of Technology Durgapur</a>.

This website was planned way back during my [highschool](https://greenfieldsschool.org.in/) days, when I was first introduced to basic HTML. I have always loved creating notes. Whether be it a history lesson, or physics tutorial, I jotted down atleast few things in my *Notes Copy* back then. 
Time flew very fast and I'm here at college - rarely taking any notes during my classes. Not because I don't enjoy it anymore - but due to the fact that every study material I go through, is already condensed - thereby, defeating the purpose of note taking. 

However, I still write. I prepare notes of [[Problems\|coding problems]], [[DS Notes\|data structures]], [[Algorithms\|algorithms]], [[Tutorials\|tutorials]] which I encounter in my learning [[Journey\|journey]]. Here are some [[Quotes\|quotes]] I found worth noting down. Also, if you are interested, here are my [[Thoughts\|thoughts]] on various topics, which may or may not be offending.
