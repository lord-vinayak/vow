I am Vinayak, a 21 year old student, web-developer and sometimes a procrastinator. ðŸ˜œ
I also love to solve coding problems on online judges like LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc. which now I believe have become necessity for me to get a real job. In my free time, I make (or at least learn to make) cool websites. 

I can code in 4 languages, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, efficiency decreasing in same order. I also have learnt how to create websites using MERN stack and I'm currently learning GSAP.

In the past, I have done some work for MathonGo as content developer intern, which mostly involved proofreading a lot of notes, question papers of physics, chemistry and mathematics. I also sometimes helped to create mock question papers for national competitive exams like BITSAT, WBJEE, etc.
In May 2025, I was offered a two-month research internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU), where I learnt about preprocessing techniques used on medical ECG datasets for training machine learning models for prediction or classification of cardiac arrhythmia. I also had to work on Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research articles published in various scientific journals. It was also perhaps my first experience of living in peak 49Â°C, all thanks to the holy city of Varanasi.

#### The Past
I have attended Greenfields School, Lucknow for my high school. I was *according to my teachers* the most talkative person in the *entire class*! I made two life-long friends there, from whom I still try to keep contact whenever I'm in my home town. Otherwise, it's just months of radio silence. 
I also participated in some competitions like Impromptu, Quiz, Elocution, etc. organized in my school. None of which helps me today and upon reflecting back, I shouldn't have prepared so hard for those.
Fun fact which not many people remember, I was a [^2]black belt [^1]Taekwondo player till high school. I practiced for 4 years and participated in national level, district level and inter-school competitions and won gold, silver and bronze medals.

#### The Future
>[!quote] Albert Einstein
>I never think of the future, it comes soon enough.

I want to become a reliable, independent and educated person.
