I am Vinayak, a 21 year old student, web-developer and sometimes a procrastinator. ðŸ˜œ
I also love to solve coding problems on online judges like LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc. which now I believe have become necessity for me to get a real job. In my free time, I make (or at least learn to make) cool websites. 

I can code in 4 languages, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, efficiency decreasing in same order. I also know how to create websites using MERN stack and I'm currently learning GSAP.

In the past, I have done some work for MathonGo as content developer intern, which mostly involved proofreading a lot of notes, question papers of physics, chemistry and mathematics. I also sometimes helped to create mock question papers for national competitive exams like BITSAT, WBJEE, etc.
In May 2025, I was offered a two-month research internship at IIT-BHU, where I learnt about preprocessing techniques used on medical ECG datasets for training machine learning models for prediction or classification of cardiac arrhythmia.
