I have completed my schooling from [Greenfields School](https://greenfieldsschool.org.in/). I passed my senior secondary examination in 2022 and started preparing for the infamous Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). I also joined [Aakash Institute](https://www.aakash.ac.in/) for a year and quickly realized I didn't need to. 

Fast forward to 17 August 2023, I came to National Institute of Technology Durgapur for pursuing my Bachelors degree. This, I believe, will be the most important phase of my life, apart from the [[JEE Journey\|JEE phase]]. I met the most wonderful and also some of the most terrible people here. 
I quickly discovered that college was just a meticulously crafted illusion and the only thing it offered was just a piece of paper at the end of your four year stay telling the world that yes, you are now an [^1]*Engineer*! Surprisingly, that paper holds a very high value in eyes of my parents and the society, even if I don't know which terminal is positive on a standard battery.
Here I am continuously learning a lot of things and I will try to document them here. To begin with, here are few -
